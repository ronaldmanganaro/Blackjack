        <p style="text-index: 40px">
          <t>My blackjack program allows 1 - 3 players to play against a computer controlled dealer. The user is prompted to enter the number of players and then each of the players names.
          The first player to the right of the dealer is allowed to either hit or stay. If the player decides to hit then they will recieve a card and the total next to the corresponding
          players name will change. The player is allowed to hit until their total exceeds 21. If the players hit the stay button it will become the next players turn. After the dealer
          finishes his turn the game ends and the player with the highest score wins. This program can be compiled and run on linux operating systems only.
        </p>
